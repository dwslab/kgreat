In a move to reassert control over the party's seven senators, the national executive last night rejected Aden Ridgeway's bid to become interim leader, in favour of Senator Greig, a supporter of deposed leader Natasha Stott Despoja and an outspoken gay rights activist.",

AMP's half-year profit sank 25 per cent to $303 million, or 27c a share, as Australia's largest investor and fund manager failed to hit projected 5 per cent earnings growth targets and was battered by falling returns on share markets.",

On the flood frontline at Dongting Lake, the water level peaked at just under 35m on Saturday night, then eased about 3cm during the day under a hot sun, with temperatures reaching 35C. But with the lake still brimming at dangerously high levels, and spilling over the top of its banks in some places, locals were fearful that a thunderstorm and high winds forecast to hit the region last night would damage the dikes. About 1800km of dikes around the lake are all that stand between 10 million people in the surrounding farmland and disaster.",
